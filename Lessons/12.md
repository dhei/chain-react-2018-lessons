# Lesson 12: Platform customization with module overrides

There are many fully cross-platform modules in React Native core and the third-party module ecosystem, but sometimes we simply need to support different behaviors on different platforms. A great way to diverge implementations for each platform is using platform overrides for modules. 

## Remove the app entry point override

The React Native CLI `windows` command generates a Windows-specific app entry point, `App.windows.js`. This file can be deleted. This file is really only needed when generating a React Native project with the default template from the React Native CLI.

## Add a stub implementation for image classification

In Lesson 5, we abstracted the image recognition for the `react-native-tensorflow` package logic into a module, `ImageRecognizer`. Stub out the implementation for Windows in a *platform module override* (i.e., `ImageRecognizer.windows.ts`).

```ts
export default class ImageRecognizer
{
  constructor(options)
  {

  }

  recognize(data)
  {
    return Promise.reject('not implemented');
  }
}
```

## _Exit Criteria_
1. A working camera app that generates the "not implemented" error when taking a photo.
