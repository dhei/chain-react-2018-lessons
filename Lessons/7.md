# Lesson 7: Continuous Deployments
[TODO DESCRIPTION]

1. Quick navigate to the build service for your Android or iOS application using the VS Code extension.
2. Open your master build configuration and add the following environment variables.
```
CUSTOM_VISION_PROJECT_ID = "Grab project identifier from Custom Vision settings."
CUSTOM_VISION_SECRET = "Grab secret from Custom Vision settings."
APPCENTER_ACCESS_TOKEN = "Generate a new token from the App Center accounts page."
ASSETS_RELATIVE_PATH = "/assets"
```
3. Create a `appcenter-post-build.sh` script in the root of your project folder to trigger retraining and an automatic CodePush with the latest model.
appcenter-post-build.sh
```bash
# Install custom vision tooling
mkdir ac_traing && cd ac_traing
python -m pip install azure-cognitiveservices-vision-customvision
python train_and_export_model.py $CUSTOM_VISION_SECRET
node CodePushRelease.js $APPCENTER_ACCESS_TOKEN "$OWNER_NAME/$APP_NAME" 
```
4. Commit the changes to verify App Center successfully builds and pushes your latest changes.

## _Exit Criteria_
1. App Center app configured to automatically retrain your Custom Vision model and deliver it to clients using CodePush.
