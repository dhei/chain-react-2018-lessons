# Lesson 7: Iterative Distribution
Deploying a new project using the App Center extension automatically links CodePush and App Center SDK's to your project for a frictionless setup experience. Releasing updated models to users becomes a pain free process you can perform at any time.

1. Export your newly created coreML or TensorFlow model from the Performance tab.
2. Replace the model and label file in your assets directory.
3. Bring up the command palette in VS Code and start typing `React Native Release` to find the CodePush menu option.
4. Push your app to the Staging deployment.
5. Reopen the app on your phone and test image classifier.

## _Exit Criteria_
1. Tensorflow model exported from Custom Vision service and added to app.
2. CodePushed model deployed to phone and working.
