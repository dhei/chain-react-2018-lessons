# Lesson 2: Project Creation

Create an empty folder on your computer and open VS Code.

```
mkdir chainreact
code chainreact
```

Log in to the App Center extension using CMD+SHIFT+P to open the command palette or the App Center button in the task bar.

## Custom Template
The App Center VS Code extension includes the ability to bootstrap a project from scratch in order to enable quick development and testing with App Center and CodePush. A custom setting for overriding the project template can be used to substitute a project template with your own preferred custom setup.

1. Fork the [workshop](https://github.com/pniko/chain-react-2018) starter repository to your local Github account.
2. Open the command palette in VS Code and search for the `Open Workspace Settings` option.
3. Add workspace settings to override the template project the App Center VS Code extension uses to create new projects.
```
{
    "appcenter.demoAppGitRepo": "[INSERT CLONE URL FOR FORK]",
    "appcenter.api.configurebranchandstartnewbuild": true
}
```
4. Open the VS Code command palette in VS Code and search for `Start a new project`. 
5. Wait for the project to be created and configured for use in App Center.

# Sign and Distribute
Development will require you deploy the project to your iPhone or Android device. Quick navigate to either app in App Center and configure your iOS signing certificate and profile or Android java keystore.

## _Exit Criteria_
1. App Center VS Code extension authenticated for VSTS and App Center.
2. Starter repository forked to Github account.
3. Workshop project has been created locally on your computer.
4. App Center apps for Android and iOS have been created and built.
5. Android or iOS app is signed and configured for distribution in App Center.
