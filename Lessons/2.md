# Lesson 2: Project Creation
The App Center VS Code extension includes the ability to bootstrap a project from scratch in order to enable quick development and testing with App Center and CodePush. A custom setting for overriding the project template can be used to substitute a project template with your own preferred custom setup.

1. Create an empty new repository in Github and clone it to a folder on your machine and open it up in VS Code.
3. Fork the  to your local Github account.
4. Open the command palette in VS Code and search for the `Open Workspace Settings` option.
5. Add workspace settings to have the extension use the [workshop](https://github.com/pniko/chain-react-2018) starter repository when provisioning new projects from scratch.
```
{
    "appcenter.demoAppGitRepo": "[INSERT SSH OR HTTPS CLONE URL]",
    "appcenter.api.configurebranchandstartnewbuild": true
}
```
6. Log in to the App Center extension using CMD+SHIFT+P to open the command palette or the App Center button in the task bar.
7. Open the command palette and search for `Start a New Project`. Enter an application name and select an App Center location for your new React Native iOS and Android applications.

## Sign and Distribute
