# Lesson 2: Project Creation

Create an empty folder on your computer and open VS Code.

```
mkdir chainreact
code chainreact
```

Log in to the App Center extension using CMD+SHIFT+P to open the command palette or the App Center button in the task bar.

## Custom Template
After logging into the extension, open the command palette and search for `Start a New Project`. Enter an application name, select the VSTS project for your new git repository and an App Center location for your new React Native iOS and Android applications.

# Sign and Distribute
Development will require you deploy the project to your iPhone or Android device. Quick navigate to either app in App Center and configure your iOS signing certificate and profile or Android java keystore.

4. App Center apps for Android and iOS have been created and built.
