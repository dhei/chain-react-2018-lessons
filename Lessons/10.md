# Lesson 10: Add react-native-windows to the app

The first step when getting started with `react-native-windows` is to generate the native project for UWP.

Please note, if you are running Windows 10 on a VM (e.g., using Parallels), it is recommended that you re-clone your repo and re-install the node packages on the Windows VM. There will likely be issues with trying to build and run the UWP app from any mapped directory to the host OS.

## Generate the native project

Using the `rnpm-plugin-windows` NPM package and the React Native CLI, generate the UWP native project for your app.

- Install `rnpm-plugin-windows`.
- Ensure the React Native CLI, `react-native-cli` is installed globally.
- Generate the UWP project with the React Native CLI `windows` command.

If you installed the dependencies on Windows 10 using `npm` instead of `yarn`, be sure to delete the `yarn.lock` file from your repo to make the `windows` command work.

## Run the UWP app on Windows 10

Test the app with the React Native CLI `run-windows` command.

## _Exit Criteria_
1. Visual Studio 2017 solution for UWP that runs the default React Native app template.
