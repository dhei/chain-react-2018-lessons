# Lesson 13: Create custom native module for Windows ML

React Native has a rich ecosystem for third-party native modules, but many of these modules are not yet supported on Windows. Fortunately, creating native modules for `react-native-windows` is simple, and has a lot of symmetry with React Native for Android.

## Open the generated UWP project in Visual Studio 2017

Using the Developer Command Prompt for VS 2017, run:
```
devenv windows\<project>.sln
```

## Add required classes for the native module

We'll need to add two classes to our app projects for the native module:
- [`RNOnnxModule.cs`](https://gist.github.com/rozele/9acb6ee6631a3c15918c7deb5afaf166)
- [`RNOnnxPackage.cs`](https://gist.github.com/rozele/639d05321d319be59d8376b760e79794)

## Add React package to ReactNativeHost

Update your `MainReactNativeHost.cs` file to include the native React package you just added to the project:
```csharp
        protected override List<IReactPackage> Packages => new List<IReactPackage>
        {
            new MainReactPackage(),
            /* ... */
            new RNOnnxPackage(),
        };
```

**NB:** In lesson 9, we used `react-native link` to update our solution file and this `MainReactNativeHost.cs` file. We could have also added the `react-native-camera` dependency manually by:
1. Adding `RNCamera.csproj` to the app solution
2. Adding a project reference from our app project to `RNCamera.csproj`
3. Updating the `MainReactNativeHost.cs` with the `RNCameraPackage`

## Implement the stub image classification module

In Lesson 10, we stubbed out the implementation for the `ImageRecognizer` on Windows. Now that we have a custom native module for image classification, we can fill out this implementation.

```js
import { 
  Image,
  NativeModules 
} from 'react-native';

export default class ImageRecognizer
{
  constructor(options)
  {
    const resolvedModel = Image.resolveAssetSource(options.model).uri;
    const model = resolvedModel || options.model;
    this.init = NativeModules.RNOnnx.load(model);
    const resolvedLabels = Image.resolveAssetSource(options.labels).uri;
    this.labels = resolvedLabels || options.labels;
  }

  async recognize(data)
  {
    await this.init;

    return await NativeModules.RNOnnx.evaluate(data, this.labels);
  }
}
```

## _Exit Criteria_
1. `MainReactNativeHost.cs` file includes reference to custom native module package.
2. App still builds and runs successfully with `run-windows` command.
