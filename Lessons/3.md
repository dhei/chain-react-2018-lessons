# Lesson 3: Setup Camera App
Now that setup is complete we'll start building our camera application.

1. Add `react-native-camera` to your project by running `npm i "rozele/react-native-camera#windows" --save`
2. Link new package by running `react-native link`
3. Add a simple camera to the App component.
```javascript
import Camera from 'react-native-camera';

<Camera
  ref={(cam) => {
    this.camera = cam;
  }}
  style={styles.preview}
  aspect={Camera.constants.Aspect.fill}>
</Camera>

```
4. Add button and its handler to the App component for capturing an image.
```html
<Text style={styles.capture} onPress={this.takePicture.bind(this)}>
  [CAPTURE]
</Text>
```
```javascript
async takePicture() {
  const options = {};
  try
  {
    const data = await this.camera.capture({metadata: options});
    alert("Picture taken");
  }
  catch (err)
  {
    alert(err);
  }
}
```

## _Exit Criteria_
1. `react-native-camera` package added and linked.
2. Working camera view in main app layout.
