# Lesson 3: Project Preparation

The sample project includes components and views not required to complete the demo. We'll want to clean up the project before working on the main workshop app.

1. Remove all tsx files under `screens` except for `codePushScreen.tsx` and `welcomeScreen.tsx`.
2. Update RootTabNavigator to only contain the WelcomeScreen and CodePush.
```
const RootTabNavigator = TabNavigator(
  {
    Welcome: {
      screen: WelcomeScreen,
    },
    CodePush: {
      screen: CodePushScreen
    }
  },
  {
    initialRouteName: 'Welcome',
    tabBarOptions: {
      style: {
        backgroundColor: "#252525"
      },
    },
    navigationOptions: {
      tabBarVisible: false,
    },
    lazy: false,
    swipeEnabled: true
  }
);
```
3. Run `pod install` in the `ios` folder if you have an iPhone to make sure all your packages have been downloaded.

## _Exit Criteria_
1. Application can be run in iOS or Android simulator.
2. Only two screens visible in app are the Welcome and CodePush screens.
