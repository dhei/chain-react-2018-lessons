# Lesson 11: Add native modules to react-native-windows app

`react-native-windows` supports the `link` command for linking native dependencies to your project. We'll use this to link the `react-native-camera` dependency that was installed in Lesson 4.

## Link the native dependency

Using the React Native CLI `link` command, add the `react-native-camera` native dependency to your solution.

## Add the necessary device capabilities to your app package manifest

Open `windows\<project>\Package.appxmanifest` and add the following to the `<Capabilities>` section:
```
    <uap:Capability Name="picturesLibrary" />
    <DeviceCapability Name="microphone" />
    <DeviceCapability Name="webcam" />
```

## _Exit Criteria_
1. `MainReactNativeHost.cs` file includes reference to `react-native-camera` package.
2. App still builds and runs successfully with `run-windows` command.
