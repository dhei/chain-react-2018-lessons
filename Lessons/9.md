# Lesson 9: Adding Analytics


The App Center VS Code extension includes the ability to bootstrap a project from scratch in order to enable quick development and testing with App Center and CodePush. A custom setting for overriding the project template can be used to substitute a project template with your own preferred custom setup.

1. Fork the [workshop](https://github.com/pniko/chain-react-2018) starter repository to your local Github account.
2. Open the command palette in VS Code and search for the `Open Workspace Settings` option.
3. Add workspace settings to override the template project the App Center VS Code extension uses to create new projects.
```
{
    "appcenter.demoAppGitRepo": "[INSERT CLONE URL FOR FORK]",
    "appcenter.api.configurebranchandstartnewbuild": true
}
```
4. Open the VS Code command palette in VS Code and search for `Start a new project`. 
5. Wait for the project to be created and configured for use in App Center.
