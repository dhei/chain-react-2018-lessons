# Lesson 14: More platform customization with the `Platform` module

In Lesson 13, we talked about module overrides for platform customization, but for smaller customizations, like selecting assets, we can use the `Platform` module from React Native to add conditional logic to cross-platform modules. 

## Using `Platform.OS`

Add a ternary expression to choose the ONNX model when `Platform.OS === 'windows'`.
```js
  this.recognizer = new ImageRecognizer({
    model: Platform.OS === 'windows' 
      ? require('../../assets/model.onnx') 
      : require('../../assets/model.pb'),
    labels: require('../../assets/labels.txt'),
  });
```  

## Using `Platform.select`

The ternary or conditional expressions can get verbose when dealing with more than two platforms, so another option is to use `Platform.select`.
```js
  this.recognizer = new ImageRecognizer({
    model: Platform.select({
      windows: require('../../assets/model.onnx'),
      default: require('../../assets/model.pb'),
    }),
    labels: require('../../assets/labels.txt'),
  });
```  

## _Exit Criteria_
1. A fully working app that uses the camera and Windows ML to classify images captured by the device.
