# Lesson 14: More platform customization with the `Platform` module

In Lesson 5, we added logic to initialize our `ImageRecognizer` module with the TensorFlow model in `.\assets\model.pb`. The last remaining piece for our image classification app on Windows is to use the ONNX custom vision model instead of the TensorFlow model. If you haven't already, download the Windows ML ONNX model and place it in the same `assets` folder (rename it to `model.onnx`).

In Lesson 12, we talked about module overrides for platform customization, but for smaller customizations, like selecting assets, we can use the `Platform` module from React Native to add conditional logic to cross-platform modules. 

## Using `Platform.OS`

Add a ternary expression to choose the ONNX model when `Platform.OS === 'windows'`.
```js
  this.recognizer = new ImageRecognizer({
    model: Platform.OS === 'windows' 
      ? require('../../assets/model.onnx') 
      : require('../../assets/model.pb'),
    labels: require('../../assets/labels.txt'),
  });
```  

## Using `Platform.select`

The ternary or conditional expressions can get verbose when dealing with more than two platforms, so another option is to use `Platform.select`.
```js
  this.recognizer = new ImageRecognizer({
    model: Platform.select({
      windows: require('../../assets/model.onnx'),
      default: require('../../assets/model.pb'),
    }),
    labels: require('../../assets/labels.txt'),
  });
```  

## _Exit Criteria_
1. A fully working app that uses the camera and Windows ML to classify images captured by the device.
